      <description>Namib comes with it&amp;rsquo;s own tools that help you configuring your computer the way you want - without searching for scattered settings across the whole system and looking things up on the internet. Just open the system control panel, open the tool and select what you want.
 Choose, install, finished! Namib maintains it&#39;s own program to install, update and remove packages from the system. Just open it, choose what you want and click &#39;install&#39;.</description>

      <description>Manjaro based on the independently developed Arch operating system. Within the Linux community, Arch itself is renowned for being an exceptionally fast, powerful, and lightweight distribution that provides access to the very latest cutting edge – and bleeding edge – software. However, Arch is also aimed at more experienced or technically-minded users. As such, it is generally considered to be beyond the reach of those who lack the technical expertise (or persistence) required to use it.</description>

      <title>Donate to Namib</title>

      <description>There are many ways you can help out Namib. One way is to donate a small amount of money, to help out covering some unavoidable cost, giving developers time and freedom to improve Namib&amp;rsquo;s features and to allow spreading word about Namib.
Why does Namib ask for donations? Namib is not backed by some large corporation and solely held up by the team, the community that are willing to dedicate their time and resources to develop and improve Namib.</description>

      <description>There are two architectures available: 64 bit and 32 bit. If you don&amp;rsquo;t know which one you should choose, you can use 64 bit for more modern computers and 32 bit if you computer is an older model. If you don&amp;rsquo;t have enough information about your hardware, choose the 32 bit version, which will run on more hardware.
Both editions have exactly the same features and support and this decision is only important if you need maximum performance.</description>

      <description>For simplicity we have selected Mate for our flagship editions. If you want to look for other experiences, we created many flavours that focus around other desktops.
For example we have editions that use technology that makes them very resource-efficient and makes them a good choice for old computers. Other editions focus on breaking with user interface standards that are decades old and giving users a modern experience. As not everybody wants to have such an experience and likes a more traditional way how everything works, we have editions that focus on this traditional workflow.</description>

      <description>As like many other Linux distributions, we believe that privacy, security and keeping control is one of the most valuable things for a user. We included some clever tools to achieve all the tasks that are needed to make room for actual work, entertainment and relaxing. But you, the user, will always be in control of your own computer. It&amp;rsquo;s your hardware and your operating system.
Update when you want  Namib only shows a small notification if an update is available.</description>
