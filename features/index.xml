      <description>Namib comes with it&amp;rsquo;s own tools that help you configuring your computer the way you want - without searching for scattered settings across the whole system and looking things up on the internet. Just open the system control panel, open the tool and select what you want.
 Choose, install, finished! Namib maintains it&#39;s own program to install, update and remove packages from the system. Just open it, choose what you want and click &#39;install&#39;.</description>

      <description>Manjaro based on the independently developed Arch operating system. Within the Linux community, Arch itself is renowned for being an exceptionally fast, powerful, and lightweight distribution that provides access to the very latest cutting edge – and bleeding edge – software. However, Arch is also aimed at more experienced or technically-minded users. As such, it is generally considered to be beyond the reach of those who lack the technical expertise (or persistence) required to use it.</description>

      <description>As like many other Linux distributions, we believe that privacy, security and keeping control is one of the most valuable things for a user. We included some clever tools to achieve all the tasks that are needed to make room for actual work, entertainment and relaxing. But you, the user, will always be in control of your own computer. It&amp;rsquo;s your hardware and your operating system.
Update when you want  Namib only shows a small notification if an update is available.</description>
