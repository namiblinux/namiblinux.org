## Be secure
---

We encourage you to check if the download was not modified by some **malicious person** or by an error while downloading. As a simple check, you can generate the SHA1-sum of the downloaded file and compare it with the one we provide you here.
[Here](https://wiki.meerkat.tk/index.php/Check_a_Downloaded_ISO_Image_For_Errors) you can find information how to generate such a sum and check your downloaded files.

To even further enhance the security, verify the downloaded file with a **GPG (GNU Privacy Guard)** signature that will ensure that the file was not modified and was actually created by the Namib developers.
[Here](http://www.howtogeek.com/246332/how-to-verify-a-downloaded-linux-iso-file-wasnt-tampered-with/) you can find information how to use it.
