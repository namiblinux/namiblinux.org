Here are some first steps after you [downloaded](;baseurl;download) Namib. This guide covers only the basic steps, so if you want more information look into the [Namib User Guide](;baseurl;support/userguide/) or the [Namib Wiki](https://wiki.meerkat.tk).

So you downloaded Namib as an ISO file. An ISO file contains all files Namib needs to start an installation compressed into a handy file, which you can then use to make a [DVD](https://wiki.meerkat.tk/index.php/Burn_an_ISO_File) or [USB-Stick](https://wiki.meerkat.tk/index.php/Burn_an_ISO_File#Writing_to_a_USB_Stick_in_Linux) that can be run by your computer. This file can be directly used by a virtual machine if yout don't want to try out Namib on your actual computer, yet.

## Branching Paths
---

To try out Namib, you can either directly load it from a DVD or USB-Drive or use a  [virtual machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine) if you are unsure or want to be able to use your current operating-system without [dual-booting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-booting). Here you can find a list of all options you have and their pros and cons.

## Using a virtual machine
---
A virtual machine is a computer that runs "in" your current computer. If you just want to try or use Namib without rebooting your computer, you can set up a virtual machine. We will give you a quick step-by-step guide, but if you want to know more, visit our [Wiki](https://wiki.meerkat.tk/index.php/VirtualBox#Running_Namib_in_VirtualBox).

|   |   |
|---|---|
| ![Icon](;baseurl;/img/actions/download.svg) | **1. Download an application that allows creating virtual machines and install it** |
|                                             | You can use for example [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/), [VmWare Player](http://www.vmware.com/) or other software |
| ![Icon](;baseurl;/img/actions/vm.svg) | **2. Create a virtual machine** |
|                                             | ... for "Arch Linux" if Namib is not available as option |                                              
|                                             | ... with at least 20-30GB virtual harddrive space |                                              
|                                             | ... with at least 2GB RAM/Memory |                                              
|                                             | **Also don't forget to** |                                              
|                                             | ... give the machine at least 2 CPU cores |     
|                                             | ... increase the graphics memory |     
|                                             | ... enable 3D acceleration if possible |
| ![Icon](;baseurl;/img/try/install.svg) | **3. Load Namib** |
|                                             | • Start the virtual machine and select the Namib ISO to be loaded into the virtual DVD drive |
|                                             | • Namib will now boot. Select Namib (Free drivers) or leave it until it's automatically selected |
|                                             | • Namib now boots into the live environment |
| ![Icon](;baseurl;/img/features/installation.svg) | **4. Install Namib into the virtual machine** |
|                                             | **[Find out how this works](#install-namib)** |
| ![Icon](;baseurl;/img/actions/settings.svg) | **5. Finish the process** |
|                                             | • Go into the settings of the virtual machine and unload the Namib ISO |
|   |   |

Now you can just start your virtual computer with Namib, play around with it and use software that is not well supported on other operating systems! Note that this is (while being virtual) an actual computer, so you have to shut down Namib just like all operating systems. If you want to know what you can do after installing Namib, give a look at our [user guide](;baseurl;support/userguide/) and our [wiki](https://wiki.manjaro.org/index.php?title=Main_Page#Customisation_and_Configuration).


## Making a Live-System
---

To be able to install or try Namib on your computer, you need to put it on a DVD or USB-Drive. Then the computer will start (or "boot") from this medium into Namib's live-system[¹](#glossary).

### Create a bootable USB-Stick
|   |   |
|---|---|
| ![Icon](;baseurl;/img/actions/download.svg) | **1. Download an application that is able to create a bootable USB-Drive** |
|                                             | You can use for example [ImageWriter](https://launchpad.net/win32-image-writer/), [Rufus](https://rufus.akeo.ie/) or other software. See our [wiki](https://wiki.meerkat.tk/index.php/Burn_an_ISO_File) for more information.  |
| ![Icon](;baseurl;/img/try/live-boot.svg)     | **2. Select the ISO and the stick and put Namib onto it** |
|                                             | Please don't forget to backup the data of your stick before doing this. |
|                                             | If you need more information, just visit our [Wiki](https://wiki.meerkat.tk/index.php/Burn_an_ISO_File) |
| ![Icon](;baseurl;/img/actions/boot.svg)     | **3. Boot from USB** |
|                                             | **[Find out how this works](#booting-into-the-live-environment)**   |


### Burn a DVD
|   |   |
|---|---|
| ![Icon](;baseurl;/img/actions/download.svg) | **1. Download an application that is able to burn a disk** |
|                                             | You can use for example [DeepBurner](http://www.deepburner.com/), or if available the software that comes with your operating system |
| ![Icon](;baseurl;/img/actions/burn.svg)     | **2. Burn the Namib ISO to the DVD** |
|                                             | If you need more information, just visit our [Wiki](https://wiki.meerkat.tk/index.php/Burn_an_ISO_File) |
| ![Icon](;baseurl;/img/actions/boot.svg)     | **3. Boot from DVD** |

### Booting into the Live-System
|   |   |
|---|---|
| ![Icon](;baseurl;/img/actions/boot.svg)     | **1. Boot from USB or DVD** |
|                                             | If you are lucky, just have to plug-in the drive or put the DVD into the tray and restart your computer. |
|                                             | But sometimes you need to configure your system to allow this.  Then you may find help here:|

| ![Icon](;baseurl;/img/actions/settings.svg)     | **2. Choose the drivers** |
|                                             | If you boot into the live-system, you can choose between "free" and "proprietary" drivers. |
|                                             | • Choose "proprietary" if you use a Nvidia graphics card or need wireless  |
|                                             | • Choose "free" if you are using a virtual machine or know that everything will work without proprietary drivers  |
|                                             | If you want more information, take a look at our [user guide](;baseurl;support/userguide/).   |

Now you have booted into Namib's live-environment and can begin to play around with it or proceed to install Namib on your computer (or the virtual machine). In the next section, you can find a quick step-by-step guide how to install Namib.

## Install Namib
---
There are many different ways to install Namib and the process depends heavily from your current hardware. If you want more detailed steps, you will find them in our [user guide](;baseurl;support/userguide/). Here we will give you a rough outline how to install Namib.

|   |   |
|---|---|
| ![Icon](;baseurl;/img/actions/install.svg)  | **1. Start the installer** |
|                                             | If you boot into the live-system, there's a welcome-window that has an option "Install" or "Installation using Calamares". Click on this option to start the installer. |
|                                             | If you closed the welcome-window, you can find it in the application menu as "Namib Welcome". |
| ![Icon](;baseurl;/img/actions/settings.svg)  | **2. Put in your data** |
|                                             | Insert your timezone, preferred keyboard layout and language. |
| ![Icon](;baseurl;/img/actions/partition.svg)  | **3. Determine where Namib should be installed** |
|                                             | If you use a virtual machine or want to wipe your whole system (keep in mind that if you use a virtual machine, you only wipe the machine, not your actual computer) choose "erase disk". |
|                                             | Otherwise the installer offers plenty of options such as installing Namib alongside your current operating system. Experienced users also can partition manually. |
|                                             | We recommend to take a look at the [user guide](;baseurl;support/userguide/) and our [wiki](https://wiki.meerkat.tk/index.php/BIOS_and_UEFI) to make sure that nothing goes wrong. Also we recommend to make backups of your important data before installing Namib. You can do this directly in the live-environment if you forgot it.   |
| ![Icon](;baseurl;/img/try/install.svg)  | **4. Finish the installation** |
|                                             | • Insert your account data and wait until the installation is finished. You can use the live-environment while doing an installation to maybe watch some videos or browsing the web.|
|                                             | • Restart your machine |

Congratulations! You have now installed Namib. If there are any problems, you can maybe find a solution [here](;baseurl;support/commonproblems), our [user guide](;baseurl;support/userguide/) or our [wiki](https://wiki.meerkat.tk). Our [user guide](;baseurl;support/userguide/) also contains information how to use Namib. Also we recommend to visit our [forums](https://forum.meerkat.tk/forums/) where people discuss about problems, new programs and make customizations like wallpapers.

## Glossary
|   |   |
|---|---|
| **Live-Environment / Live-System**  | Namib and many other Linux distributions allow running the system directly from a USB-Drive or DVD.<br/>Those "Live-Enviroments" are completely functional systems and can be used as portable operating-system or to rescue data if something went wrong.  |
